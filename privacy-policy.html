                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to Invoice Maker ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains our data practices regarding our iOS mobile application (the "App"). We want to be completely transparent: <strong>Invoice Maker does not collect, store, transmit, or use any personal data or user information whatsoever.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This policy describes how our app operates entirely on your device without any data collection, tracking, or external communication.
                </p>

                <h2>No Data Collection</h2>
                <p>Invoice Maker is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect any information from you, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> No names, email addresses, phone numbers, or contact details</li>
                    <li><strong>Invoice Data:</strong> Your invoices, client information, and business data stay entirely on your device</li>
                    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> No device identifiers, operating system details, or hardware information</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> No analytics, tracking, or monitoring of how you use the app</li>
                    <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> No access to or collection of location information</li>
                    <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> No automatic crash reporting or error logging</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Local Data Storage Only</h2>
                <p>
                    All data you create in Invoice Maker is stored exclusively on your device using local storage. This includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Invoice information and templates</li>

                    <li>Business information and logos</li>
                    <li>App settings and preferences</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Important:</strong> Since data is stored locally only, it will be lost if you delete the app or reset your device. We recommend regularly backing up important invoices by exporting them as PDFs.
